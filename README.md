# Project Submissions

## 1) Assignment - Linear Regression
Model the price of cars with the available independent variables. Using Statistical Modeling, Recursive feature elimination methods, different methods of data visualisation. 

## 2) Telecom Churn - ML Case Study
Analyse customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn and identify the main indicators of churn. Using principal component analysis to reduce features in the dataset for better modeling of data. Used basic logistic regression, random forest, decision tree, xgboost classifiers to build the models and compare their performance.

## 3) Assignment - Syntactic Analysis (Natural Language Processing)
POS Tagging of words in a sentence using different modified Viterbi methods.

## 4) Building Chatbots With Rasa
Create a chat bot using RASA which helps find users restaurants with a specific budget using the Zomato API. The chat bot also handles basic user queries like greetings.

## 5) Neural Networks- Assignment
Implementation of an L-layered deep neural network and train it on the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset contains scanned images of handwritten digits, along with their correct classification labels (between 0-9). The MNIST's name comes from the fact that it is a modified subset of two data sets collected by NIST, the United States' National Institute of Standards and Technology.

## 6) Neural Networks Project - Gesture Recognition
Build a 3D Conv model that will be able to predict the 5 different hand gestures correctly using frames of hand gesture video recorded.

## 7) Assignment - Tic-Tac-Toe 
Build an RL agent (using Q-learning) that learns to play Numerical Tic-Tac-Toe with odd numbers. The environment is playing randomly with the agent, i.e. its strategy is to put an even number randomly in an empty cell.

## 8) Reinforcement Learning Project
Build an RL-based algorithm which can help cab drivers maximise their profits by improving their decision-making process in the field. Taking long-term profit as the goal, we propose a method based on reinforcement learning to optimize taxi driving strategies for profit maximisation. This optimization problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process. The Goal is to create the environment, build an agent that learns to pick the best request using DQN and track convergence.

## 9) Capstone - Question Answering Network
Create a transformer based model which can give answers to any question asked for the given passage. For this application we have used a pre-trained model BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for language generation.
